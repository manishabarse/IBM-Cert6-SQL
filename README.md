# IBM-Cert6-SQL-SQLite

Used SQLite in the Jupyter Notebook to:

 - Understand three Chicago datasets
 - Load the three datasets into three tables in a SQLite database
 - Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions

# Student Course Analysis

The student_course_analysis code is a Python script that analyzes data from a hypothetical student and course database. This project analyzes students and courses data stored in a SQLite database. The database contains two tables: `students` and `courses`, which store information about students and the courses they are enrolled in, respectively.

## Data Description

### students Table
- `id`: Unique identifier for each student.
- `name`: Name of the student.
- `age`: Age of the student.
- `grade`: Grade level of the student.

### courses Table
- `id`: Unique identifier for each course.
- `course_name`: Name of the course.
- `instructor`: Name of the instructor teaching the course.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Basic Queries**: Retrieve basic information from the `students` and `courses` tables.
2. **Aggregation Functions**: Use aggregation functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG to analyze the data.
3. **Data Manipulation**: Update, insert, and delete records in the tables.
4. **JOIN Operations**: Perform JOIN operations to combine data from both tables.
5. **Advanced Queries**: Use advanced SQL queries to perform complex analysis.
6. **Additional Features**: Implement additional features such as sorting, filtering, and grouping.
